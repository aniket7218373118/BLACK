        <h1>THIS IS FOR YOU </h1>
        <p>Oh my sister, you should always keep smiling, what happened this 3 year journey has ended today but understand that you will never forget me and whenever you think of forgetting me then think once, even if you think about it I will not let you forget me, and talking about calls and chats, if I have to go to Warora or from Warora to Pune, I will meet you first and then i will go, remember I always with you if you need me, at any time, anywhere, and in any situation I will always stand with you,

            I have never talk like these with anyone till date, you were the first one, I talked like these, you are not my real sister but no less than a real sister. I had never even thought that I would ever know the routes of Nagpur but you took me around full Nagpur, I am always thankful to God for giving me the memories, also the sister like you. Till date I have never been sad due to any reason other than family and career but today your letter has made me sad.</p>
